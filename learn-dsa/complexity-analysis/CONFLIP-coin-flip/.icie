After a lot of research, Little Elephant came to know that most of the animals in the forest were showing less interest to play the multi-player games. Little Elephant had started to invent single player games, and succeeded in inventing the new single player game named <strong>COIN FLIP</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this game the player will use $N$ coins numbered from $1$ to $N$, and all the coins will be facing in &quot;Same direction&quot; (Either <strong>Head</strong> or <strong>Tail</strong>), which will be decided by the player before starting of the game.</p>\n<p>The player needs to play $N$ rounds. In the $k$-th round the player will flip the face of the all coins whose number is less than or equal to $k$. That is, the face of coin $i$ will be reversed, from <strong>Head</strong> to <strong>Tail</strong>, or, from <strong>Tail</strong> to <strong>Head</strong>, for $i \\le k$.</p>\n<p>Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing a particular face after playing $N$ rounds. Elephant really becomes quite fond of this game <strong>COIN FLIP</strong> so Elephant plays $G$ times. Please help the Elephant to find out the answer.</p>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The first line of input contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. Then $T$  test cases follow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The first line of each test contains an integer $G$, denoting the number of games played by Elephant. Each of the following $G$ lines denotes a single game, and contains $3$ space-separated integers $I$, $N$, $Q$, where $I$ denotes the initial state of the coins, $N$ denotes the number of coins and rounds, and $Q$, which is either $1$, or $2$ as explained below.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here $I=1$ means all coins are showing <strong>Head</strong> in the start of the game, and $I=2$ means all coins are showing <strong>Tail</strong> in the start of the game. $Q=1$ means Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing <strong>Head</strong> in the end of the game, and $Q=2$ means Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing Tail in the end of the game.</p>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<p>For each game, output one integer denoting the total number of coins showing the particular face in the end of the game.</p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<p>$1 \\le T \\le 10$</p>\n<p>$1 ≤ G ≤ 2000$</p>\n<p>$1 ≤ N ≤ 10$</p>\n<p>$1 ≤ I ≤ 2$</p>\n<p>$1 ≤ Q ≤ 2$</p>\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<pre><code>1\n2\n1 5 1\n1 5 2\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<pre><code>2\n3\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p>In the 1st game in Example,\n$I=1$, so initial arrangement of coins are H H H H H,\nand now Elephant will play 5 rounds and coin faces will be changed as follows&lt;\nAfter the 1st Round: T H H H H\nAfter the 2nd Round: H T H H H\nAfter the 3rd Round: T H T H H\nAfter the 4th Round: H T H T H\nAfter the 5th Round: T H T H T\nFinally Q=1, so we need to find the total number of coins showing Head, which is 2</p>\n<p>In the 2nd game in Example:\nThis is similar to the 1st game, except Elephant needs to find the total number of coins showing <strong>Tail</strong>.\nSo the Answer is $3$. (Please see the final state of the coins in the $1^{st}$ game)</p>\n\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
