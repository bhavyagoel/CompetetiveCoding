Chef had assigned the $\\textbf{tastiness}$ $T_1$ and $T_2$ to the first and to the second dish respectively. The tastiness of the dishes can be any $\\textbf{integer}$ between $0$ and $N$ (both inclusive).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Chef has forgotten the values of $T_1$ and $T_2$ that he had assigned to the dishes. However, he remembers the sum of the tastiness of both the dishes - denoted by $S$.</p>\n<p>Chef wonders, what can be the maximum possible absolute difference between the tastiness of the two dishes. Can you help the Chef in finding the maximum absolute difference?</p>\n<p>It is guaranteed that at least one pair ${T_1, T_2}$ exist such that $T_1 + T_2 = S, 0 \\leq T_1, T_2 \\leq N$.</p>\n\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
